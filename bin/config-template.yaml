# Package short name - route path map, used by express server.
# By default, every package's is mapped to a route context path "/<package short name>"
# e.g.
#   if package name is "@dr/example-dr", default route root path will be `/example-dr`
# If you want change this rule, config route path here.

entryPageMapping:
    # For static browser entry pages, the default entry page is compiled to
    #   dist/static/<package-short-name>/<entry-page-path>
    # so for example when you access page with browser, the URL is like
    #  "http://<host>:<port>/<package-short-name>/<replative-page-path>/index.html"
    #
    # If you want to change the URL to another folder like "http://<host>:<port>/<another-path>/<replative-page-path>/index.html",
    # do add a key-value pair <package-short/full-name>: <new-folder-path> like,
    #   package-A: /
    #   package-B: /entriesB
    #   package-C: entriesC
    # It doesn't matter whether the "value" part startsWith or endsWith slash "/",
    # but if the value is only a slash "/", it means the root folder "dist/static"

# Change your source code folder here
