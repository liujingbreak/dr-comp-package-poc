I18n component examples
---------

This folder contains 2 components
- #### example-i18n
	Entry package, an i18n enabled component
- #### example-locale-zh
	a localization component

example-i18n loads example-locale-zh for locale 'zh'.

example-locale-zh demonstrates how we can implement a dedicated component for specific locale.

So i18n is not only about some resource like text messages for different locale, but also customized business logic component for  different locale.
