# @dr web component platform

This is core part of a web pluggable component platform project run by dianrong.com, which includes a command line tool for developer and deployer, a couple of node packages as internal components and a private NPM registry server.

Main purpose of this platform or tool is helping web developers, a team or a company to
- decouple and modularize their NodeJS based web project or web app product
- share and reuse pluggable components between different web project or product in a smarter way than git branching or file copy
- easily deploy and reassamble web products by plugging different components and configurations

in a way of packing and run mutiple web apps on one platform.
