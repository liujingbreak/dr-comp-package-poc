- decouple and modularize their NodeJS based web project or web app product
- share and reuse pluggable components between different web project or product in a smarter way than git branching or file copy
- easily deploy and reassamble web products by plugging different components and configurations

in a way of packing and run mutiple web apps on one platform.
